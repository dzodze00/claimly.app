            At Claimly, our mission is to empower consumers by helping them recover compensation they're legally
            entitled to through class action settlements. We believe that everyone deserves access to the settlements
            they qualify for, without the complexity and confusion that often surrounds the claims process.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Claimly was founded in 2025 by a team of tech entrepreneurs who recognized that billions of dollars in class
            action settlements go unclaimed each year. We built Claimly to bridge this gap, creating a platform that
            simplifies the process of finding and filing claims, ensuring that consumers receive the compensation they
            deserve.
